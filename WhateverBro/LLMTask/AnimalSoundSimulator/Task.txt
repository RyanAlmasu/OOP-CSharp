 Task: Animal Sound Simulator
You are tasked with designing a simple Animal Sound Simulator. The program should simulate different animals and the sounds they make using interfaces and inheritance.

Requirements:
Create an Interface called ISound that includes a method:

MakeSound(): to print or return the sound the animal makes.

Create a Base Class called Animal that includes:

A property for the animal's name.

A method Describe() that returns the name of the animal.

Create Derived Classes for at least three animals (e.g., Dog, Cat, Cow) that:

Inherit from Animal.

Implement the ISound interface.

Provide specific implementation of MakeSound().

Write a function to:

Instantiate the animals.

Store them in a list or array of type Animal or ISound.

Loop through and call Describe() and MakeSound() on each.
